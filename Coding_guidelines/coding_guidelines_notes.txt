1. when you are making a get request by id , and if no result is found then throw the error  , on the other hand if you 
making the get request using the params then no result is found then it should not throw the error . This params get call
should have all the params in the one call and shoudl return the list of objects for this .
if search parameter are  many then use the post request for this 

2. no crud operation will happen without coming api layer in between
